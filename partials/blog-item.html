This&#x000A;week, meet Envy’s CFO, Bernie Mapili</em>.&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><img alt="Bernie Mapili" src="/images/bernie-mapili.jpg" /></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><strong>What is your role at Envy?</strong></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>As the CFO, my primary role is making sure we stay on a healthy financial&#x000A;course. I can’t code nor design but if there’s a business angle to it, I can&#x000A;help. Over the past 5+ years, we’ve built a lifestyle business where people are&#x000A;paid well doing what they love. We’re more than proud of the great clients we&#x000A;get to work for and build kickass things all day long.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>The majority of my career has been spent in “Corporate America” where you had to&#x000A;work 60 hours a week to keep your job and brown-nosing superiors was a part of&#x000A;the daily routine, but at least the employees were taken care of with retirement&#x000A;and benefits. It’s incredibly rewarding to find a way to bring the best of old&#x000A;school Corporate America to a company that values home life and healthy work&#x000A;relationships.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><strong>What has been the biggest risk you’ve taken to move forward?</strong></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>The road to self employment has been the most difficult business risk to date. I&#x000A;have the <em>Big Four</em> on my resume, so finding a comfortable spot in the corporate&#x000A;ladder and leading a typical corporate CPA life would have been an easy path to&#x000A;retirement. But it comes at the cost of time with your family when your life&#x000A;consists of long hours and late nights. All my mentors took this route.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>For me, the money is not a good enough reason to kill yourself day in and day&#x000A;out and sacrifice family time. I saw an opportunity to go self employed, lost my&#x000A;first house, tapped into savings, and grew a couple businesses to support the&#x000A;life we have today. Since then, I’ve sold the clear winners and losers and kept&#x000A;the businesses that have the highest satisfaction and/or ROI. The number one&#x000A;question I get today is someone asking “should I go self employed?” I respond&#x000A;with three questions for them to answer:</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <ol>&#x000A;
                                    <li>Do you feel a calling to do it as if from God?</li>&#x000A;
                                    <li>Will you sell to anyone and tolerate excessive rejection?</li>&#x000A;
                                    <li>Do you truly have a real product or service and a reasonable plan to&#x000A;profitability?</li>&#x000A;</ol>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>All it takes is one “no” or “I don’t know” and that’s enough for them to keep&#x000A;praying and plan it out further. Self employment is simply not for the weak or&#x000A;unsure. It’s hard journey with 5–10 years of hard grind up front. But I’d rather&#x000A;do this and enjoy my family for 20+ years, instead of going the way of Corporate&#x000A;America and my mentors of hard grinding every single day until I retire.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <blockquote>Actually work in [your target industry] yourself. That way … the&#x000A;numbers … are more than beans on a table</blockquote>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><strong>How would you recommend someone start a career in finance?</strong></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>The best “first steps” experience is actually operational experience. If&#x000A;somewhere in finance/accounting is your end goal, then the start should be&#x000A;seeing how your targeted industry actually operates on the day-to-day. Actually&#x000A;<em>work</em> in the field yourself. That way once you see the numbers, they are more&#x000A;than beans on a table; each bean comes alive and the numbers are more&#x000A;meaningful. Suddenly it’s not just the boring snoozefest routine revenue you are&#x000A;analyzing. <em>Hey, why is billable revenue so low this month?</em> Before you&#x000A;analyze the beans and dig into individual employee time tracking, think for a&#x000A;moment. <em>Oh, that’s right—most of the Dev team was at</em> Ember Conf <em>in Portland.</em></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><strong>What’s different about dealing with finances for a tech company?</strong></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>From a general sense and core responsibilities, finance and accounting are the&#x000A;same everywhere. Cash go up? <em>Good</em>. Cash go down? <em>Bad</em>. Difficulty comes&#x000A;in random spurts: <em>Is this a recurring everyday expense or are we venturing down&#x000A;the road of R&amp;D?</em> And advising based on the situation.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><strong>What is the future of the tech, as you see it?</strong></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>The next significant leap in internet use will be augmented reality, whether&#x000A;from wearable tech or devices that project an image onto any surface. Imagine a&#x000A;world without a tiny screen on your wrist or a giant smart phone wedged in your&#x000A;skinny jeans just to check your email, text, social media, etc. Actual, true&#x000A;holograms still feel too <em>Star Trek</em>-y to me for now, but interactive&#x000A;projections would be amazing.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><em>Side note: say “no” to skinny jeans.</em></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><strong>What was an unexpected experience you had affected your career for the better?</strong></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>I got my first job in high school when my girlfriend at the time convinced her&#x000A;boss to hire me. Yes, you know why I took the job—to be with her! But the role&#x000A;paid surprisingly great commission, and even though I took the position&#x000A;expecting it to be a dead-end high school job, I ended up learning a lot about&#x000A;sales. Introverted-me learned how to be an extravert, I learned how to convert a&#x000A;cold lead into a sale, and learned how to manage first impressions.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <blockquote>At the end of the day, everyone is selling something.</blockquote>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><strong>What’s a life experience you think everyone should have?</strong></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>Sales. At the end of the day, everyone is selling <em>something</em>, whether it’s&#x000A;direct, passive, actual product, service, their experience, etc. Sure, a used&#x000A;car salesman approach is reprobate, but even if you aim to be a trusted advisor&#x000A;you are selling guidance and knowledge.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>For some reason I always wanted to learn how to make eyeglasses, so in college I&#x000A;got a job doing just that. When I was hired, they ended up needing a lot of help&#x000A;on the sales floor, so I did both: I made eyeglasses as well as sold them. Which&#x000A;goes to show: even if you make something yourself, you often still have to sell&#x000A;it.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><em>Side note: I could make a single vision pair in under 15 minutes; for bifocal&#x000A;or progressive it could take me 30 minutes to an hour depending on your RX and&#x000A;frame type!</em></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <blockquote>Owning multiple businesses is great … but my family is my crowning&#x000A;achievement</blockquote>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><strong>What life achievement are you most proud of?</strong></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>Owning multiple businesses is great, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/26/online-learning-service-pluralsight-acquires-code-school-for-36-million/">selling Code School for $36&#x000A;million</a> is definitely a highlight, but my family is my crowning&#x000A;achievement. I won’t launch into a history lesson on my upbringing, but choosing&#x000A;to be home as much as I am is literally an answered prayer. Raising my kids and&#x000A;investing in my marriage is the true American dream (cue the fireworks, American&#x000A;Flags, and jets with colored smoke trails).</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><strong>What is your favorite place to visit but not live?</strong></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>Hawaii. Weather seemed better than Orlando and the folks seem more relaxed. But&#x000A;island fever would definitely hit me hard, especially since I love driving on&#x000A;more than three highways and a handful of country back roads.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p><strong>What would you be doing if you weren’t working in finance?</strong></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;
                                <p>Assuming bills didn’t have to be paid and family didn’t need food, I would do&#x000A;social work. In my free time I enjoy helping family-friendly charities that&#x000A;operate at 90% or greater efficiency such as <a href="http://sunshinefoundation.org/">The Sunshine&#x000A;Foundation</a>. It’s nice to think that 90¢ out of every $1 you give is&#x000A;actually going to the end participant. Spoken like a true accountant—I know.</p>&#x000A;</div>
